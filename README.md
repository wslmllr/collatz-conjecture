# collatz-conjecture
This thing tests if your number reduces to 1 by the collatz conjecture. My first project. Took me ~20 minutes.
Thanks for downloading! Means a lot. You should know what the collatz conjecture is before using it, but there's a small description in the program. Run the boolean method to get the proper return value.
